[[opsi-manual-localboot-standardprodukte]]
==== opsi standard products

The following products are basic products which come with the 'opsi-server' installation.

[[opsi-manual-localboot-opsi-client-agent]]

===== '{opsi-winst}'

The '{opsi-winst}' packet is a special case. It includes the actual '{opsi-winst}' `winst32.exe`, which is updated by the '{opsi-client-agent}' packet itself. The '{opsi-client-agent}' checks the server for there is a different version of the `winst32.exe` and then copies the new '{opsi-winst}' (all it's files) to the client.

===== config-win10

Configure various Windows 10 settings like lockscreen, hibernationboot, telemetry sending and update behavior.

* *change_power_plan* Change the machine power plan.

* *config_updates* gives one the possibility to handle the update source. The options are to select Microsoft servers, a local peer-to-peer or a peer-to-peer over the internet as an update source. Die option 'disable' moved into an own property, named 'disable_updates'.

* *defer_upgrade*: One can defer Updates and Upgrades of Windows 10. Setting this property to 'true' defers Updates for four weeks and Upgrades for eight months. However security updates will be installed anyway.

* *disable_advertising_id*: The advertising ID is used to collect data within the browser and show user-specific advertisement. Set this property to 'true' to disable this.

* *disable_cortana*: The Cortana assistant in Windows 10 collects data on performed seaches through the search field in the task bar. To change this behaviour use this property.

* *disable_customer_experience* can dis- or enable the data collection on used applications.

* *disable_defender*: Windows 10 has the Windows Defender preinstalled. To deactivate the defender and replace it with an own anti-virus-solution use the property 'disable_defender'.

* *disable_font_streaming*: Whenever a document uses a font which is not installed on the system the missing font is streamed to the machine. This can be disabled by setting the peroperty 'disable_font_streaming' to 'true'.

* *disable_handwrite_sharing*: On modern tablet computers with Windows 10 Microsoft collects data whenever the user uses a pen or anything similar to write something. This handwrite sharing feature is controlled by the property 'disable_handwrite_sharing'

* *disable_location_sensors*: Windows 10 logs informations on the current geolocation of the device. This property makes it possible to disable this logging.

* *disable_lock_screen* disable_lock_screen.

* *disable_mac*: Windows 10 also collect data on the currently logged in Microsoft account user. This can be changed with the property 'disable_mac'

* *disable_mrt*: Windows 10 has an auto built in 'Malware Removal Tool' (MRT). This tool checks the file on the harddrive on a regular basis and compares them with known malware. To disable this feature, set the property to 'true'.

* *disable_onedrive_sync* disable the OneDrive file synchronization.

* *disable_sending_feedback* can disable the feedback service. This service send data to Microsoft in crashed applications.

* *disable_smbv1* disable smbv1.

* *disable_telemetry* influences the amount of transfered data to Microsoft. Usually the default level, full, transfers most data. Setting this property to 'true' lowers the amount of transfered data. Windows 10 LTSB and Enterprise releases will then only communicate security related information. Any other Windows 10 release will lower the level to 'basic'.

* *disable_updates* blocks connections wo Microsoft update sources when set to 'true'. Setting the property to 'false' enables these connections again.

* *disable_wifi_sense*: 'WiFi Sense' service makes it possible to share WiFi SSIDs inclusing password with contacts. The 'disable_wifi_sense' property can disable or enable this service.

* *flashplayer_autorun*: The Adobe Flashplayer contains a security vunerability related to its autorun feature. If one has the Flashplayer installed, please use the 'flashplayer_autorun' property to disable or enable the autorun feature.

* *online_search*: Whenever one uses the search field within the task bar a search is also performed through the internet. The search result then also contains webpages even if a local file was searched. Setting the property to 'true' disables

* *sync_settings*: Windows 10 makes it possible to synchronise made settings with an account and restore these saved settings on another device running Windows 10.

[[opsi-manual-localboot-product-order]]
==== Manipulating the installation sequence by product priorities

Since opsi 4.0 the installation sequence will be calculated by regarding product dependencies and product priotities.

* product dependencies +
defines dependencies and needed installation sequence between opsi-packages. A typical example is the dependency between a java program and the java runtime environment (javavm).

* product priorities +
will be used to push some packages to the beginning of the installation sequence and other packages to the end. For example it is useful install service pack and hotfixes at the beginning of a installation sequence and software inventory at the end. +
Product priorities are numbers between 100 and -100 (0 is the default)

There are different possibilities how these two factors are used to calculate the installation sequence. According to this opsi provides two different algorithms.

You may switch between these algorithms:

* using the opsi-configed, in the 'Host parameter' Tab of the 'server configuration'

.'{opsi-configed}': server configuration
image::configed_serverconfiguration_en.png["opsi-configed: server configuration",width=500]

or you can do this on the commend line:
[source, prompt]
----
opsi-setup --edit-config-defaults
----

.Choose the sort algorithm: Part 1
image::opsi-setup-product_sort_algorithm.png["Choose the sort algorithm: Part 1",width=300]

.Choose the sort algorithm: Part 2
image::opsi-setup-product_sort_algorithm2.png["Choose the sort algorithm: Part 2",width=300]

[[opsi-manual-localboot-product-order-algorithm1]]
===== Algorithm1: product dependency above priority (default)

Using this algorithm, the product installation sequence at first will be calculated by the product priorities. In a second step it will be resorted to met the product dependencies. This algorithm may push products with low priority before products with higher priority to met the needs of product dependencies. But therefore you will not see installation problems as result of not resolved product dependencies. +
The installation sequence of products with action requests is exactly the sequence you see in the configed if sort the products by the products by the column 'position' and its order even if the scripts have partly been executed. Especially, if the execution of a script is stopped by an "ExitWindows /ImmediateReboot" command, then it is guaranteed that the suspended product installation is directly continued after reboot.

[[opsi-manual-localboot-product-order-algorithm2]]
===== Algorithm2: product priority above dependency

The base philosophy of this algorithm is, that in practice there are three needed priority classes:

* Products which have to be installed at the beginning of a sequence, like OS-Patches. These products need a high priority (e.g. 100)

* "normal" products to install applications (default priority = 0)

* Products which have to be installed at the end of a installation sequence, like software inventory. These products need a low priority (e.g. -100)

Product dependicies will only resolved inside of priority class. This guarantees that products with a high priority will be installed very early. But is in your reponsibility that there are non product dependencies which go cross priority class borders.

[[opsi-manual-localboot-product-order-create]]
===== Defining product priorities and dependencies

Product priorities and dependencies belong to the meta data of a product. You will be asked for these meta data creating a new product using the command
`opsi-newprod`.

These meta data will be stored in the product control file and may be edited there. After changing the control file you have create and install the package again.

For more details see at 'getting started' manual in the chapter creating a opsi-package.
